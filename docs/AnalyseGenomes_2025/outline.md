In this training, you will:

1.  **Access your Google Cloud account using your academic email address**

    You have been provided with Google Cloud Education coupons to comfortably
    run a Google Cloud Engine (GCE) Virtual Machine (VM).

2.  **Deploy your own Galaxy server by launching a VM from a Virtual Machine Image (VMI)**

    :warning: These steps should be completed outside of class hours as they
    are time-consuming. Class time will be dedicated to using Galaxy and performing analyses.
     
    ==During the class session of Monday afternoon (December 1st)==, you will:

3.  **Review the operations to stop, start, and restart your Galaxy server** (running on your Google VM).

4.  **Verify that your Galaxy server contains all the data needed for the upcoming analyses.**
    * This includes genome reference indexes, reference data (RNA classes, GTF files, etc.),
    and sequencing datasets.

5.  **Compare the procedures for performing a simple file formatting task**, using both the command line (Linux environment) and the Galaxy interface.

By the end of this training, you should be familiar with the Galaxy analysis
environment and ready to perform analyses of small RNA-seq and RNA-seq datasets,
as described [here](https://slecrom.github.io/AG2024/).
