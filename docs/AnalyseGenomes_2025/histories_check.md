You should have now three distinct histories.

- [x] Genomic references in an history `References`
- [x] RNAseq datasets, organized in 2 collections, in an history `RNAseq Analysis`
- [x] small RNAseq datasets in an history `Small RNAseq Analysis`

Indeed, you can visualize these 3 histories side-by-side:

Click on the upper-right icon in the history side bar (right handside of the
Galaxy interface).

Select the item `Show Histories Side-by-Side`

This menu takes you to the "History multiview" feature. This view mode is
convenient for various datasets managements, for instance for copying datasets
between histories (just drag and drop the datasets over the histories)

It is also handy to have a global view of your analyses in Galaxy (especially
if you gave appropriate and meaningful names to theses histories).

Thus, in the current mutiview, you should see your three dataset histories
side-by-side, similarly to the following image.
