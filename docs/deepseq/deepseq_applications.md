### High throughput sequencing of DNA or RNA provides ==Qualitative (sequence)== and ==Quantitative (number of reads)== information.

**Whole Genome sequencing (WGS)**

:   - [x] De novo sequence assembly for new genomes
:   - [x] Re-sequencing indel, mutation, snp identification and analysis

**Exome sequencing**

:   - [x] capture probe to sequence only exons


**RADseq, ddRADseq**
:   - [x] Sampling of genome to be sequenced


**Meta-genome sequencing**
:   - [x] Pathogen / symbiotic flora identification or analysis


**ChIPseq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing)**
:   - [x] Epigenetic landscape, Transcription factor binding sites


**ATACseq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin)**
:   - [x] DNA accessibility (chromatin compaction, transcription factorsâ€¦)


**3C-seq (Chromosome conformation capture), 4C, 5C, ChIA-PET, Hi-C**
:   - [x] mapping of long-range genomic interactions

**Medip-seq**
:   - [x] DNA methylation studies

**RNA or small RNA sequencing**
:   - [x] Transcriptome
:   - [x] Small or long non-coding RNA profiling
:   - [x] Single cell transcriptome analysis

**RIP-seq (RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing)**
:   - [x] Protein associated RNAs

**CLIP-seq (Cross-linking immunoprecipitation sequencing)**
:   - [x] Protein associated RNA duplexes
