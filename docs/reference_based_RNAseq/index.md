##  Galaxy Spring Day 2019 - Reference-based RNAseq analysis
#### March 21st 2019

In this training session, we are going to perform a RNAseq analysis
as first outlined in Galaxy training material for
[Reference-based RNAseq analysis](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html)

We have updated the instructions given in this training material
and put these instructions in this readthedoc site for the spring day 2019.

We will propose the update for a pull request to the galaxyproject
[training-material](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material) repository

In this tutorial, we will deal with:

1. Pretreatments
    1. Data upload
    2. Quality control
2. Mapping
    1. Mapping
    2. Inspection of the mapping results
3. Analysis of the differential gene expression
    1. Count the number of reads per annotated gene
    2. Viewing datasets side by side using the Scratchbook
    3. Identification of the differentially expressed features
    4. Visualization of the differentially expressed genes
    5. Analysis of functional enrichment among the differentially expressed genes
