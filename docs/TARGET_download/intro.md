TARGET data are available from different, overlapping public repositories/databases.

-----

### The [NIH, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, Genomic Data Commons (GDC)](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/gdc-overview)

is  to provide the cancer research community with a unified data repository that enables data
sharing across cancer genomic studies in support of precision medicine.

TARGET data, and more specifically for this use case TARGET-AML data, can be [accessed directly from the GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TARGET-AML), since it is hosting the OCG and its TARGET project (see bellow).
There is also access to publication pages related to the projects, for instance here
[https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/TARGET-AML-2017](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/TARGET-AML-2017)
where some instructions and paths to data are available.

### The [Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG)](https://ocg.cancer.gov/about-ocg)

is a **program** of the GDC aimed at supporting research
programs that enhance the potential of precision oncology by improving the molecular definition
of cancer subtypes—including rare and/or high-risk—and identifying potential novel strategies that
can be translated into effective patient treatments.

The OCG is hosting [several running or finished programs](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs),
including the running [TARGET program](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target).

Finally, TARGET is hosting several [TARGET projects](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target) including the
[TARGET-AML](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/projects/acute-myeloid-leukemia)
we are interested in for this use case.

------
In the next section, we experiment one procedure to download TARGET-AML datasets, using the GDC interface.
Importantly, some datasets of the GDC are tagged as `controlled` and are only available to validated users.
This use case does **not** cover the download of `controlled` datasets. The procedure to obtain authorizations for accessing `controlled` data will be reviewed elsewere.
