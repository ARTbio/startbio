TARGET data are available from different, overlapping public repositories/databases.

-----

### The [NIH, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, Genomic Data Commons (GDC)](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/gdc-overview)

is  to provide the cancer research community with a unified data repository that enables data
sharing across cancer genomic studies in support of precision medicine.

### The [Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG)](https://ocg.cancer.gov/about-ocg)

is a **program** of the GDC aimed at supporting research
programs that enhance the potential of precision oncology by improving the molecular definition
of cancer subtypes—including rare and/or high-risk—and identifying potential novel strategies that
can be translated into effective patient treatments.

The OCG is hosting [several running or finished programs](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs),
including the running [TARGET program](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target).

Finally, TARGET is hosting several [TARGET projects](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target) including the
[TARGET-AML](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/projects/acute-myeloid-leukemia)
we are interested in for this use case.
