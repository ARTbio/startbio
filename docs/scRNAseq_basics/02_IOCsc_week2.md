# Reduction of dimensions

Now, you have a clean expression matrix and you want to identify cluster of populations. But
first, you'll need to explain as much variability in as few dimensions as possible. Because
for the moment you can only describe your cells in 2000 dimensions (maybe a little complex
for the poor human eye and also for a computer !). To learn more about the different method,
you must read the following page : [Reduction of dimensionality](./redim.md).
