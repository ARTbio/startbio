# Clustering

We have our cells in a dimensional space that can be easier to be interpreted. It's time to
identify similar transcriptome to obtain clusters of cell populations ! To do so, we use
a non-hierarchical clustering method based on an SNN graph (Shared Nearest Neighbors). You
can read the [clustering](./clustering.md) page to master the concept !

# Render your RMD/QMD

To complete this week you'll need to :

- [x] 1. Compute the clustering at several resolutions (ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 with a step size of 0.2)
- [x] 2. Visualize result with `clustree`, select the resolution and **explain your choice** 
- [x] 3. Visualize the clusters using the selected resolution and to explore results, have fun !

!!! warning "IMPORTANT"
    Please note you **must** be explicative in your cutoff choices and
    provide detailed explanations for each step of your thought process 
    In general, try to explain in your own words for each step of your analysis !

Add your RMD/QMD in your Trello card. You can also add the html version of your rapport.


**Thank you for your attention and see you next week :clap: :clap: :clap:**
