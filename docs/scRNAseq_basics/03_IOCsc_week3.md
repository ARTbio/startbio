# Clustering

We have our cells in a dimensional space that can be easier to interpert. It's time to
identify similar transcriptome to obtain cluster of cell populations ! To do so, we use
a non-hierachical clustering method based on a SNN graph (Shared Nearest Neighbors). You
can read the [clustering](./clustering.md) page to master the concept !

# Render your RMD/QMD

To complete this week you'll need to :

- [x] 1. Compute the clustering at several resolutions (0.2 to 1.2 with a step of 0.2)
- [x] 2. Visualize result with clustree and choose the resolution **explain your cutoff** 
- [x] 3. Compute visualizations to explore, have fun !

!!! warning "IMPORTANT"
    Please note you **must** be explicative in your cutoff choices and detailled
    each step of your thoughts. 
    In general, try to explain in your own words, each step of your analysis !

Add your RMD/QMD in your Trello card. You can also add the html version of your rapport.


**Thank you for your attention and see you next week :clap: :clap: :clap:**
