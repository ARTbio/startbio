# Cluster Annotation and Visualisations

You did it ! You succeed to perform the different types of gene set annotations ! Even if,
the dataset is a little complex, with the help of your results and the paper you can identify
the associated cell type for your clusters. You can read the following pages to finish the
IOC : [Cluster annotation](./clusannot.md) and [Visualisations](./visualization.md) !! 

Well Done !

- [x] 5. Have fun with the `VlnPlot`, `FeaturePlot` and `DimPlot` functions

!!! warning "IMPORTANT"
    Please note you **must** be explicative in your cutoff choices and
