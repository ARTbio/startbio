Now it's your time to shine ! We are going to put into pratice what we 
have just seen. By using a more complicated use case, you are going to 
reproduce the whole scRNAseq analysis with Seurat.  

# Dataset test

The dataset for this analysis will be single cell RNAseq from chick embryos 
from [de Lima *et al*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24157-x). We are 
going to analyse only single cell of E10 stage of embryos. You can download 
the dataset at the GEO accession [GSE166981](https://0-www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.brum.beds.ac.uk/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE166981).

!!! question "What type of data do you retrieve ?"
    1. Fastq Files
    3. BAM Files
    2. Expression matrix  
    --> Right answer (1)
    
1. You only need the expression matrix !

??? tip "Do you know where to find the data ?"
    Tips 1 : (2)  
    Tips 2 : (3)  
    Tips 3 : (4)  

2.  Look to supplementary file....
3.  To see what's inside the tar archive you can click on `(custom)`
4.  You need the three files with *"E10"* in the filename
