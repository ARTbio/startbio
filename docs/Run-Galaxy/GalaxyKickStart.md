## Installation of a Galaxy server with Ansible and the GalaxyKickStart playbook

### What is Ansible ?

![Ansible](images/ansible.png)

Ansible is an automation engine that automates configuration management and application
deployment.

Ansible reads instructions (Tasks) from a playbook and performs the indicated tasks on
target machines (Hosts), through an ssh connection.

There is no magics: everything an "administrator" can do using command lines of a linux OS,
can be automated with ansible that "wraps" these command lines.
The power of Ansible (and similar orchestration software, ie Puppet, Chief, etc.) comes
from the abstraction of complex suite of commands in the Ansible syntax.
Moreover, automation allows to reproduce exactly the desired configuration.
Finally, Ansible is `idempotent`: whatever the initial configuration, it brings the target
to the exact same final state. This is useful to repair a broken configuration.

### Ansible playbook - GalaxyKickStart

The Ansible "language" (Striclty speaking, Ansible language is *not* a programming language)
is structured. Thus a playbook is not necessarily a single flat file. Multiple tasks can be gathered in a file, a "role" is the execution of a set of tasks, and a playbook can execute multiple roles.
 
GalaxyKickStart is an Ansible playbook that will

- install basic dependencies needed for Galaxy
- Create and manage all the linux users involved in the deployment of Galaxy
- Install and configure the services required for Galaxy:
  - postgresql (database engine)
  - nginx (web server)
  - docker (containers)
  - proftpd (ftp server)
  - slurm (job manager)
  - supervisor (service manager)
- Configure Galaxy for using these services
- Install tools and workflows using the bioblend API.

The code of the GalaxyKickStart playbook is freely available at the ARTbio GitHub
Repository [https://github.com/ARTbio/GalaxyKickStart](https://github.com/ARTbio/GalaxyKickStart).

### Deployment

- start a GCE VM `2 procs, 7.5Gb RAM, Ubuntu 16.04, 50 Go disk, http enabled`
- connect to you VM using the Google ssh console
- start an interactive session as root using the command `sudo -i`
- download the script `run_galaxykickstart.sh` using the command `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARTbio/Run-Galaxy/master/deployment_scripts/run_galaxykickstart.sh`
- run the script using either the command
`sh run_galaxykickstart.sh biogen2018; sh run_galaxykickstart.sh biogen2018`

*OR* (to be decided during the training)

`sh run_galaxykickstart.sh pasteur-2018; sh run_galaxykickstart.sh pasteur-2018`

The installation is expected to take about 20 min for `biogen2018` or ~40 min for `pasteur-2018`

- When the deployment is finished, connect to your ansible-deployed "GalaxyKickStart" instance:
    
    Just click on the url displayed in your Google Cloud Engine Console.
    
- Connect to your server as an admin:

    This time, ansible and the GalaxyKickStart playbook already programmatically registered
    an admin user. Just use the `admin@galaxy.org:admin` as credentials (user:password)
    
    When logged in, see that required tools as well as workflows are already installed !
    
### Transfert input data to you newly deployed Galaxy instance (for you incoming analyses)

- Click on the small wheel at the top right of your Galaxy interface (history menu)
- select the `importer depuis un fichier` menu (or `import from a file` if you have the English interface)
- copy this url :
  - [http://134.158.246.184/history/export_archive?id=f597429621d6eb2b](http://134.158.246.184/history/export_archive?id=f597429621d6eb2b)
- repeat the same operation with: 
  - [http://134.158.246.184/history/export_archive?id=1cd8e2f6b131e891](http://134.158.246.184/history/export_archive?id=1cd8e2f6b131e891)
  - [http://134.158.246.184/history/export_archive?id=ebfb8f50c6abde6d](http://134.158.246.184/history/export_archive?id=ebfb8f50c6abde6d)


#### the run_galaxykickstart.sh script explained

NB: in the following code, numbers in line heads should be removed to run the script.

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
apt update -y
apt install -y python-pip python-dev python-setuptools git htop
echo "Upgrading pip"
pip install -U pip
pip --version
pip install ansible==2.4
ansible --version
git clone https://github.com/ARTbio/GalaxyKickStart.git -b $1
cd GalaxyKickStart/
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements_roles.yml -p roles/ -f
ansible-playbook -i inventory_files/galaxy-kickstart galaxy.yml
echo "end of deployment\n"
```

0. The shebang line (`#!`) says that it is a script code that has to be executed
by the shell bash which can be found in the /usr/bin/env environment
1. set -e says to the bash interpreter to exit the run at first error (to avoid catastrophes)
2. update apt package database
3. install `python-pip`, `python-dev`, `python-setuptools` (these 3 packages are required to
install pip), `git` (to clone and manage GitHub repositories) and `htop` (a monitoring tool)
using the package installer `apt-get`
4. Is just a command to inform the user about run state. This will prompt
"Upgrading pip version" in the console
5. does what is stated before ! : this is the command to upgrade the pip program that was
installed with installation of `python-pip`, `python-dev` and `python-setuptools`.
`pip` is a recursive acronym that can stand for either "Pip Installs Packages" or
"Pip Installs Python".
6. will prompt the version of pip in the console
7. install `ansible`, version 2.4, using `pip` !
8. will prompt the version of ansible in the console
9. clone the GalaxyKickStart Repository available at https://github.com/ARTbio/GalaxyKickStart.git,
branch indicated as a parameter in the command line, creating locally the `GalaxyKickStart` folder.
10. Change directory, ie goes to /root/GalaxyKickStart
11. says to ansible to install additional roles (collection of files to control ansible)
which are not the the GalaxyKickStart repository but whose address is stated in the file
`requirements_roles.yml`. These roles will be installed in the subdirectory
`/root/GalaxyKickStart/roles/`. NB: `ansible-galaxy` has *nothing* to do with Galaxy,
the name of this ansible command is serendipitous.
12. triggers the play of the playbook `galaxy.yml` by ansible. The target host of the playbook
is defined in the file `inventory_files/galaxy-kickstart`, as well as how ansible will interact with the target.
Here, we play the playbook on the same computer (localhost).
13. Prompt the end of deployment. Galaxy should be up and running.
