## Training Menu

Three methods of Galaxy server deployment will be explained in this tutorial, which can be
used with personal computers, clusters of machines or virtual machines in cloud computing
environment.

All you need is an ssh access and the control of tcp/ip ports of the target machine.
These two conditions are far more easily fulfilled with virtual machines in clouds. This is
the reason why we are going to use
[virtual machines in the Google Cloud Engine](spin_off_VM.md). 

### Outline of the training session
-----

##### 1. Deployment of a Galaxy server in a VM using `git`
##### 2. Deployment of a Galaxy server using `Ansible`
##### 3. Use case of Galaxy administration:
  - Install a computational workflow
  - Install tools for its proper execution
  - Running the workflow.
##### 4. Deployment of a Galaxy server using `Docker`
##### 5. Packaging and distribution of a virtual machine.
