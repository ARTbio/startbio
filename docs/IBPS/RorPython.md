Hello dear Christophe,

I was a student in the Pasteur Mouse Genetic course this year and I am contacting you to have your opinion about the following.
I have always wanted to learn how to code and now I have a lot of time to do it with this epidemic.
But I have a difficult decision to make, R or Python? What do you think would be better for me as a biologist that is interested
in analysing RNA sequencing data, bulk or single cell.

I am open to advices like particular sites or handbooks to learn.

Hi Yazan,

Hope you're doing well. You're right, this strange period is a fantastic opportunity to learn coding !

There is no clear cut answer to your question. It depends whether your plan is to establish a solid ground
to built over computing expertise (1), or more pragmatically to acquire rapidly an actionnable expertise to analyse data (2).

If (1) I would say python

If (2) I may say R. Yet even in this case, you mentioned very contrasted examples. Analysing sequencing data from bulk
RNAseq may require a good understanding of the linux system and a good expertise of a "good" programming language,
which python is. Whereas analysing single cell RNA seq will pull you in the area of advanced statistics and classification,
the natural area for using R.

From a wider perspective I would tend to advise python if you are really attracted by programming and algorithms.
Learning python will drive you in good practices in computing sciences just because the python community is computing sciences oriented.

If you are more attracted by data mining per se, or by statistics, then this is a call for R !

Make no mistakes: I love programming and I like equally python and R**. But I must say that R is an "archaic" language,
poorly structured with a complex logics and with a poorly controlled environment (unfortunately, as a beginner you will
not notice that), which, generally speaking, does not produce good programmers. Nevertheless, I have known Programming
masters that started with R or even visual basic...

[*] As a typical french bioinformatician, I prefer python when I am programming R and vice versa...

With regards to training materials:

I have started python (I was already a perl and php geek at that time) with a book that is very good "[Programming Python](https://www.bookdepository.com/Programming-Python-Mark-Lutz/9780596158101?redirected=true&utm_medium=Google&utm_campaign=Base1&utm_source=IE&utm_content=Programming-Python&selectCurrency=EUR&w=AFFPAU9SQKV21DA8VCCC&pdg=pla-293946777986:cmp-9463711619:adg-98687126840:crv-420380901788:pos-:dev-c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6sHzBRCbARIsAF8FMpUXZaKEWgURqbB4K5hPwMcte9K1cL4Zx7zwQVzVcGiHkzfoOONvIYwaAs0gEALw_wcB)",
probably after having a look to "[Learning Python](https://www.bookdepository.com/Learning-Python-Mark-Lutz/9781449355739?redirected=true&utm_medium=Google&utm_campaign=Base1&utm_source=IE&utm_content=Learning-Python&selectCurrency=EUR&w=AFFPAU96193P48A8VCC4&pdg=pla-293946777986:cmp-9463711619:adg-98687126840:crv-420380901788:pos-:dev-c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6sHzBRCbARIsAF8FMpUhBFrnkyiv_oIv8pilHRWETchAfFTuaG1DEGvKSeJCq-onc7i3pTMaArnaEALw_wcB)" but I am not sure anymore.
To be honest I have learned a lot through a "pull" approach rather than a "push" one: You start building a code after having
defined a clear objective of what you want to program. Then you search for what you need with your friend Google.
In this mode, there is an essential site: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Here you will find Gold nuggets and diamonds...
provided you are motivated and well organised to capture the knowledge and methods that underly the know-how of contributors.

To finish, I value a lot MOOCs, which mix the best of the push and pull worlds. For french speaking people there is [FUN mooc](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/cours/#search?query=python&page=1&rpp=50).
For english speaking people, you can have a look [there](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=python&utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_content=93-BrandedSearch-INTL&campaignid=1599063752&adgroupid=58953588445&device=c&keyword=coursera%20mooc%20courses&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=343730227912&hide_mobile_promo=&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6sHzBRCbARIsAF8FMpVbjr7eAEogGpNNCAoxe56EcYOvAQI3Txb6z1-QO3AkjusyHdTtdgAaAkdTEALw_wcB),
but there are numerous instances.

Best.

Christophe
