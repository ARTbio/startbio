## 3.  Launch the workflow

- Select `Yes` for **Send results to a new history**
- Edit the **History name** to something that makes sense to you (`Translocation Re-Analysis`, for instance)
- Select the `Patient Data` Collection (but it should already be selected as this is the only collection in the history)
