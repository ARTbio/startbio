## Mouse Genetics - Training session - Finding translocation breakpoints with `lumpy-sv`
### January 30th

In this training session, we are going to analyse 2 datasets from two patients using Galaxy
in order to find translocations between BCR (chr22) and ABL1 (chr9).

We will visualize the coverage of these two genes by the datasets sequencing reads.

We will use the tool **[lumpy](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2014-15-6-r84)**
to find putative translocations sites in patients genomes
and we will visualize the position of these sites in the genome.
