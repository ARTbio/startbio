In this training, we are going to

1. Discuss the requirements for FAIR bioinformatics analyses
    - perfom a simple bioinformatics task using command lines
    - perform the same task using a public Galaxy server
3. Deploy your own Galaxy server in a Google Virtual machine
4. Connect, use and administer your own Galaxy Server

By the end of the training session, you should have prepared your Galaxy analysis environment
and get it ready to perform subsequent analyses of small RNAseq and RNAseq datasets as
described [here](https://slecrom.github.io/AG2021/)
