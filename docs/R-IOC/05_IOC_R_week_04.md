## Learning the two dimensional objects

Now you are familiar with the basics of R,
we will learn two more complexe data structures, the `matrix` and the `data.frame`.


### Matrices

A matrix is a fundamental two-dimensional data structure that organizes data into rows and columns.
Matrices are homogeneous, meaning they store elements of the same data type, making them efficient for mathematical operations.

Please check the [matrix](r06_df_matrices.md) part in the reference manual to learn more about it.

### Data Frames

The data frame is another essential two-dimensional data structure in R.
Unlike matrices, `data.frame` can represent heterogeneous data.

You can find how to create and manipulate it in the [data.frame](r06_df_matrices.md) part of the reference manual.


## Let's practice

For each week, you'll have a set of exercices that you must render in a R script. 
After that you need to complete the following google form to answer some MCQ (Multiple
Choice Questions) where the final question is to deposit your R script. Please note that
a Rscript has the extension `.R` but it's not supported by Google Form so you must add
the extension `.txt` so your filename will be : `NAME_week4_script.R.txt`.

- [x] 

Please be aware of the best practices for your Rscript, we will be attentive to them !

Now you can fill the following quizz : [Quizz of week 4]().


**Thank you for your attention and see you next week :clap: :clap: :clap:**
