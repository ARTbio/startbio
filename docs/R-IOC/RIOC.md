## Preface

This is the training material which we will use for our R training.

We do not intend to redo yet another version of the introductory R tutorials: There are many of them, they are often excellent and deserve to be used!

Therefore, what is following is a rather classical plan to learn R and for each notion to be learned we made not only one but multiple links to content built by other authors. This is the occasion here to thank them collectively for their efforts; detailed credits will be given in addition all along the following pages.


## Session 1 : Live Welcome and Presentation of the Interactive Online Companionship.

This session will take place via videoconference.


### Introduction

The most specific feature of the programming language R compared to other languages is its extensive and specialized support for statistical analysis, data manipulation, and visualization.

In R, vectors are the primary data structure, allowing efficient manipulation and computation on entire sets of data at once. This vector-centric approach enables concise and expressive code for tasks like mathematical operations, statistical computations, and data transformations, making R well-suited for data analysis and scientific research.



1. What is available to you (your R-studio account, your slack board, the exercises, etc . \
What we will be expecting from you !
2. Through dedicated tutorials and exercises, you will be able to work and advance at your own pace.
3. To check your progress, answer your questions and drive you to the next level of the tutorials, we will meet every week and record these meeting sessions.


### An overview of R and RStudio
