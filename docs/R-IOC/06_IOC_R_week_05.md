You had an overview of the different main variable structure and how to manipulate them.
We propose to go further and learn how to improve your coding skills by using conditions
and manipulate several variable at the same time.

## Let's practice

For each week, you'll have a set of exercices that you must render in a R script. 
After that you need to complete the following google form to answer some MCQ (Multiple
Choice Questions) where the final question is to deposit your R script. Please note that
a Rscript has the extension `.R` but it's not supported by Google Form so you must add
the extension `.txt` so your filename will be : `NAME_week5_script.R.txt`.
