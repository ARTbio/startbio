## Two dimensional objects


### Matrices

A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure that stores data in a grid-like format consisting of rows and columns. It is a data structure used for mathematical computations, linear algebra operations, and storing homogeneous data. Learn more about matrices with chapter [5.3](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/r-objects.html#matrices) of Garett’s book.


### Data Frames

A data framematrix is a two-dimensional data structure that organizes data into rows and columns, similar to a table or spreadsheet. It is particularly useful for working with heterogeneous datasets where different columns can have different data types.that stores data in a grid-like format consisting of rows and columns. It’s composed of vectors arranged in columns, see chapter [5.8](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/r-objects.html#data-frames) of Garett’s book and sections [8.2.3 to 8.2.4](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/creating-matrices-and-dataframes.html#data.frame) of Philips’ book for more details. 


### Manipulating Matrices and Dataframes

Please read with attention the sections [8.3 to 8.6](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/matrix-and-dataframe-functions.html) of Philips’ book.
