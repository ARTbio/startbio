## What's the tidyverse?

The `tidyverse` is a set of R packages for data manipulation and visualisation. You can learn 
more on their [website](https://www.tidyverse.org/). It contains the following R packages : 

- `dplyr`: A Grammar of Data Manipulation
- `tidyr`: Tidy Messy Data
- `stringr`: Simple, Consistent Wrappers for Common String Operations
- `tibble`: Simple Data Frames
- `ggplot2`: Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics (coming [next](../r09_viz_ggplot2))
- `readr`: Read Rectangular Text Data (seen previously [here](../r07_data_import_export))
- `forcats`: Tools for Working with Categorical Variables (Factors)
- `purrr`: Functional Programming Tools

You can install and load all these packages with following commands : 

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

It's a collection that is really useful and powerful in data science. We are going to rely
on the book [R for Data Science (2e edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (O'Reilly Book on tidyverse, "**R4DS**" in short).

### Tibbles, the "new" data.frame

Tidyverse packages are based on the manipulation of a new type of variable, the `"tibble"`.
It's a variant of `data.frame`. Don't worry, you can manipulate `tibble` the same way as
`data.frame` that you learn previously (brackets `[ ]`, `$`, and with basics functions such 
as : `colnames`, `rownames`, `str`, *etc*.). 

What does it look like? 

```r
# An example of a tibble from tidyverse

    of "R4DS".


### Manipulating data

Some tidyverse packages such as `dplyr`, `tidyr` and `stringr` are used for manipulating 
your data. You can add/remove columns or rows, filter or manipulating strings and tables. 

!!! abstract "Take a break & Read"
    You can read the [section 3 Data Transform](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) 
    of "R4DS" where you can see the basic commands for manipulating 
    `data.frames` and `tibbles` thanks to `dplyr`.

#### Pipe operator

In the previous section, you must have noticed some weird code: `|>`. It's called a 
*pipe operator*. Tidyverse used this weird grammar to improve code readability when
you combine multiple functions to accomplish a certain task. 

The following code lines are equivalent: 

```r
# with the pipe operator
starwars |> 
  filter(species == "Droid") |>
  head()

# without the pipe operator
head(filter(starwars, species == "Droid"))
```

But for those cases where multiple, possibly more complex, functions can be combined,
it does get confusing and difficult to read.
You can imagine "Russian dolls" using pipes when they are not stacked,
this is the best way to understand and see how many dolls we have and what they look like.

!!! abstract "Take a break & Read"
    In order to be an expert of pipe operator, please go read again [section 3.4](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform#sec-the-pipe) 
    but also [section 4.3](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-style#sec-pipes) of "R4DS" that show you the best practices.

#### Tidy data

Using tibbles is not enough to make full use of the tidyverse's functionalities, you need to
tidy your data. 
Tidy a data.frame or a tibble is a manipulation of the columns in order to obtain one column = 
one variable and one row = one observation.

For instance here is the difference between tidy and untidy data : 

```r
# Untidy data
untidy_df <- data.frame(Sample = paste0("Sample", 1:7),
                        T_cells = c(72, 0, 12, 11, 4, 10, 164), 
                        NK_cells = c(118, 24, 2, 0, 30, 4, 0),
                        Endothelial_cells = c(212, 49, 0, 29, 23, 4, 125)
                        )
untidy_df
##    Sample T_cells    NK_cells Endothelial_cells
## 1 Sample1      72         118               212
## 2 Sample2       0          24                49
## 3 Sample3      12           2                 0
## 4 Sample4      11           0                29
## 5 Sample5       4          30                23
## 6 Sample6      10           4                 4
## 7 Sample7     164           0               125
```

This format is often used when operating Excel tables, but it also has some inconveniences.
What are the numbers stands for? Potatoes? Okay, I may overstate it, but for complicated
tables it may be an issue and it makes it harder to manipulate untidy data. For example, if 
you need to visualize the number of cells for each sample but also for each cell type, it's 
not possible to do so easily in R. Instead we are going to favor this architecture: 

```r
# Tidy data
tidy_df <- untidy_df |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = contains("cells"),       # Tidy all columns that starts with "Sample"
               names_to = "Cell_types",        # Resume to a new column called "Sample"
               values_to = "Nbr_of_cells")     # Store the numeric value to a column called 
tidy_df
# A tibble: 21 × 3
##    Sample  Cell_types        Nbr_of_cells
##    <chr>   <chr>                    <dbl>
##  1 Sample1 T_cells                     72
##  2 Sample1 NK_cells                   118
##  3 Sample1 Endothelial_cells          212
##  4 Sample2 T_cells                      0
##  5 Sample2 NK_cells                    24
##  6 Sample2 Endothelial_cells           49
##  7 Sample3 T_cells                     12
##  8 Sample3 NK_cells                     2
##  9 Sample3 Endothelial_cells            0
## 10 Sample4 T_cells                     11
## # ℹ 11 more rows
## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

The R function `pivot_longer` was used to tidy the data.frame, because it's a tidyverse function,
the resulting value of the variable `tidy_df` is now a tibble. As you can see, we have less
columns and more rows but now each row describes one observation.

    [section 5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy) of "R4DS".

#### Transform data

Okay now your data is ready, you can use the pipe operator with your eyes closed, it's time to
take a closer look at `dplyr` and `stringr`. Thanks to these packages, you will be able to manipulate
and transform tables as you wish. And bonus! It will be useful when you want to visualise your data!
