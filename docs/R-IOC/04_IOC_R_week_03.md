## What's a list in R ?

You became expert in vectors and how to manipulate them. It's time now to learn about
a more complex one dimensional R structure : the lists ! Thanks to them you can store
heterogeneous data. To learn more about them, how to create and manipulate them, go to
the [list](./r05_lists.md) page in the reference manual.


## Let's Practice

For each week, you'll have a set of exercises that you must render in an R script. 
After that you need to complete the following google form to answer some MCQ (Multiple
Choice Questions) where the final question is to deposit your R script.
Please note that an Rscript has the extension `.R` but it's not supported by Google Form.
To avoid this inconvenience, you need to add the `.txt` extension to make your file named as: `NAME_week3_script.R.txt`.

- [x] Create a list with vectors (numeric, character and logical) of length 15, 8 and 10 respectively. Don't hesitate to use R functions to create them without having to write them in hard copy (like : `hardcopy_vec <- c("it's", "not", "very", "effective", "that", "way")`)
    - [x] The numeric vector must follow a binomial distribution
    - [x] The character vector is the last 8 letters of the alphabet in capital
    - [x] The logical vector is composed as many true values than false in the order of your
     like but remember not written in hard copy !
- [x] Add names for each element of your list
- [x] Retrieve the character vector within your list
- [x] Retrieve the 4th value of the logical vector within your list
- [x] Filter the numerical vector within your list so that only positive 
- [x] Filter false value of the logical vector within your list

Please be aware of the best practices for your Rscript, we will be attentive to them !

Now you can fill the following quiz: [Quiz of week 3](https://forms.gle/NLFnZq2rHb9TrFso8).


**Thank you for your attention and see you next week :clap: :clap: :clap:**
