## Learning the basics of R

You are more familiar with the different tools for this IOC, especially Rstudio. 
It's good because now we can go to the heart of the matter, R !

### Variables

We'll start slowly but surely by learning what's a variable. You need to understand
what's a variable, how to create one and manipulate them. It's a key concept for R. 

You'll need to go read carefully the [variable](./r00_variables.md) page in the 
reference manual.

### Functions

The other key concept of R is the use of function. A R function is a set of R command
that achieve a specific task. 

To learn more about them, how to use and create a function, go to the [function](./r03_functions.md) page in the reference manual. 

### Best Practices

Last but not least for this week, the best practices of R programming. Some people may
disagree but for us in ARTbio, it's a very important topic. R is a language and like
all language there are rules to correctly write it. Those rules are called [best practices](./r04_bestpractices.md) 
and you can learn more on their page in the reference manual.

## Let's practice

For each week, you'll have a set of exercices that you must render in a R script. 
After that you need to complete the following google form to answer some MCQ (Multiple
Choice Questions) where the final question is to deposit your R script. Please note that
a Rscript has the extension `.R` but it's not supported by Google Form so you must add
the extension `.txt` so your filename will be : `NAME_week1_script.R.txt`.

- [x] Create a variable called `my_var` that contain your favorite color
- [x] Create a variable called `surname` with the string _Marilyn Monroe_
- [x] Create a variable with the number 9
- [x] What's its type ?
- [x] Change it to character
- [x] Calculate the Ln, log in base 2 and log in base 10 of the value 1.
- [x] Round the fraction 9/7 with 2 and then 4 decimal numbers 
- [x] Create a function that takes a value and substract the number 4
- [x] Test your function for the values : 12, 5.6 and 0 

Please be aware of the best practices for your Rscript, we will be attentive to them !

Now you can fill the following quiz: [Quizz of week 1](https://forms.gle/Y6enoxKSH5Nfa14w9).


**Thank you for your attention and see you next week :clap: :clap: :clap:**
