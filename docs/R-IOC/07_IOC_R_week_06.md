## Let's practice

For each week, you'll have a set of exercices that you must render in a R script. 
After that you need to complete the following google form to answer some MCQ (Multiple
Choice Questions) where the final question is to deposit your R script. Please note that
a Rscript has the extension `.R` but it's not supported by Google Form so you must add
the extension `.txt` so your filename will be : `NAME_week6_script.R.txt`.
