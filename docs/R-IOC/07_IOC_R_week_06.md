## Let's Practice

For each week, you'll have a set of exercises that you must render in an R script. 
After that you need to complete the following google form to answer some MCQ (Multiple
Choice Questions) where the final question is to deposit your R script.
Please note that an Rscript has the extension `.R` but it's not supported by Google Form.
To avoid this inconvenience, you need to add the `.txt` extension to make your file named as: `NAME_week6_script.R.txt`.
