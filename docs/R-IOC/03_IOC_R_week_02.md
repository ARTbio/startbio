## Learning the basics of R (2)

Based on what you learned last week, we will continue playing with R,
integrating a few new basic concepts and trying to import or export data in R.

### Vectors

Let's start with the simplest structure in R -- the vectors!
It is the foundation stone of other data structure in R.

Please use the [vector](r01_vectors.md) page in the reference manual to learn about its characteristics and manipulation.

### Operators

R has different groups of operators, for arthmetic operation, for logical operations, for assignment, *etc.*
What exactly are the operators and when to use them?
You can find answers in the [operator](r02_operators.md) page in the reference manual.

### Data Import & Export

With the help of previous basic concepts, we know you are now keen to use R to manipulate your data.
Wait a moment! How you import your data in R? You want to import data from other softwares into R?
The [data import and export](r07_data_import_export.md) page in the reference manual is your friend.
And you will of course find how to export data from R in this page.


## Let's practice

For each week, you'll have a set of exercices that you must render in a R script. 
After that you need to complete the following google form to answer some MCQ (Multiple
Choice Questions) where the final question is to deposit your R script. Please note that
a Rscript has the extension `.R` but it's not supported by Google Form so you must add
the extension `.txt` so your filename will be : `NAME_week2_script.R.txt`. 

![](images/toolbox-do-it-yourself.png){ style="width:75px"} **Do it yourself !**

- [x] Create factor of exam grades "A", "B", "C", "D", label them with "excellent", "good", "ok", "bad" respectively. What is the current reference level?
- [x] Now set the grade "B" as the reference level.
- [x] The grade "D" is no longer used in exam grades, please delete it from the vector and drop this unused level.

Please be aware of the best practices for your Rscript, we will be attentive to them !

Now you can fill the following quizz : [Quizz of week 2]().


**Thank you for your attention and see you next week :clap: :clap: :clap:**
