## Issues with GitHub ?
- [x] Does everyone have a GitHub ID ? 
- [x] Was everyone able to create a readme file and make a pull request to the repository
      [ARTbio_064_IOC_Bulk-RNAseq](https://github.com/ARTbio/ARTbio_064_IOC_Bulk-RNAseq) ?
- [x] Was everyone able to retrieve the galaxy workflow file (the one that you have
      generated during the first online meeting, with an extension .ga) and to add it in
      the repository
      [ARTbio_064_IOC_Bulk-RNAseq](https://github.com/ARTbio/ARTbio_064_IOC_Bulk-RNAseq) ?

## Data upload in PSILO, then in Galaxy from Psilo
- [x] Did everyone upload the necessary data in its
      [PSILO account](https://psilo.sorbonne-universite.fr) ?
- [x] Did everyone succeed to create direct download links ? 
- [x] Did everyone succeed to transfer its PSILO data into a Galaxy story `Input dataset`
      in its Galaxy account ?

## Issues following the Galaxy training ?

[training to collection operations](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/collections/tutorial.html)

- Check whether `Relabel identifiers` tool is understood

- Check whether `Extract element identifiers` tool is understood. Is the output dataset
  from this tool uploaded in the appropriate GitHub folder ?

## Check input datasets histories of the participants

... and their ability to create appropriate collection for the analysis
