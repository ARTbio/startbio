To compare DESeq2, edgeR and limma, we are now going to collect the lists of genes
generated in the three corresponding histories in a new history which we name `DESeq2, edgeR,
limma comparisons`.

Thus, create this history `DESeq2, edgeR, limma comparisons`, and from this history, copy
the required datasets from all three histories.

- [x] in the history `PRJNA630433 DESeq2 analysis`, get the datasets
  - top gene lists - oriented
  - top up-regulated gene lists
  - top down-regulated gene lists
- [x] in the history `PRJNA630433 edgeR analysis`, get the datasets
  - edgeR top gene lists - oriented
  - edgeR top up-regulated gene lists
  - edgeR top down-regulated gene lists
- [x] in the history `PRJNA630433 limma analysis`, get the datasets
  - limma top gene lists - oriented
  - limma top up-regulated gene lists
  - limma top down-regulated gene lists
