### Week 3
2. Questions on Week 2
    1. reference
    - GTF manipulation
- Program of the Week 3
    1. Mapping and mappers
    2. Inspection of Bam files

3. Analysis of the differential gene expression
    1. Count the number of reads per annotated gene
    2. Viewing datasets side by side using the Scratchbook
    3. Identification of the differentially expressed features
    4. Visualization of the differentially expressed genes
    5. Analysis of functional enrichment among the differentially expressed genes

Some parts of this IOC were inspired by
[Reference-based RNAseq analysis](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html)
of the Galaxy Training Network (GTN)
