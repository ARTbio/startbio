**3-hours Zoom video-conference**

## Introduction of the Companions and Instructors (10 min)
## Presentation of the IOC general workflow (Scheme) (15 min)
![](images/IOC-workflow.png)
## Presentation of the IOC tools (2 hours)
### Zoom
We currently use the Zoom software for our video-conferences.
They will be recorded and available off line in the psilo data server (see below)

Please, follow these guides lines for Zoom usage

1. Use a local, desktop Zoom application instead of the online web application. You can
   download Zoom [here](https://zoom.us/fr/download)
- Test your Zoom application once if you never used it. We will be happy to arrange a quick
  Zoom session a few days before the IOC if you feel that there may be an issue.
- Be sure that your internet connection is reasonably fast to allow __the use of your camera__.
  We much value visual interactions !
- Arrange a quiet local place for your Zoom weekly session. People talking around you are
  disturbing you as well as the other conference participants. If you cannot arrange to be
  alone in your office, please warn you colleagues well ahead the session that you will
  need peace.
- **Use a headset with a built-in microphone**. It's not a gimmick! There are now cheap
  headsets for video-conference that works well. Test your headset with your computer
  and Zoom well ahead the first IOC session.
- Prefer a Desktop (generally more powerful) to a Laptop computer.
- Use the largest screen you have (another reason not using a laptop). If you have two
  screens, even better, but then test zoom with your dual screen setup. We may have to
  leave open several windows and applications during the Zoom session. 
- Be on time at the session !
- You are welcome to use the chat panel of Zoom to exchange links, code issues etc, but
  Slack (see below) is likely better suited to this (especially because the Zoom chat is
  lost when the application is shutdown. Therefore, be sure to have you Slack board available
  during the Zoom sessions.

There are many other interesting functionalities with Zoom, which will be covered in the 
presentation.

### STARTbio
Our [STARTbio web site](https://artbio.github.io/startbio/) is the hub where we connect
all the training materials for IOCs.
To access rapidly to your bulk-RNAseq-analysis IOC, use this
[URL shortcut](https://artbio.github.io/startbio/bulk_RNAseq-IOC/IOC_RNAseq_program/)

Here, you'll find all weekly lessons, exercises, instructions, etc...

**Importantly**, you, yes, you, are welcome to propose modifications or fixes to the STARTbio
IOC web pages !
Assuming that during this IOC you will become familiar with the use of GitHub, all you
have to do is click on the pencil icon ![](images/github_pencil.png){width="25"}
at the top of each page and propose your modifications in a branch of our GitHub startbio
repository.

### Slack
Slack is a workspace to exchange messages or files, follow conversations, communicate
about issues and ideas.

If you haven't already done so, you will first need to open a
[Slack account](https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew) by providing a username and
password (you can also use authentication through Google or Apple).

If you have already a Slack account, you can connect to this account using this
[URL](https://slack.com/signin#/signin).

!!! warning "Attention !"
    If you have multiple login emails for your Slack account, it can become confusing if
    some of your workspaces are identified with one email and others with another email.
    
    This might happen, for example, if you were invited to a Slack workspace with a
    different email than the one you initially used to create your first Slack workspace.

!!! tip "Get Slack app on your local computer"
    We really strongly recommend that you use a desktop version of the slack application
    on your computer(s).
    
    Once installed, this desktop Slack application will connect to
    your Slack account(s) and import locally your workspace, including the workspace
    dedicated to this IOC
    
    [Apple Desktop Slack](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slack-for-desktop/id803453959?mt=12)
    | [Windows Desktop Slack](https://slack.com/intl/fr-fr/downloads/windows)

Last but not least, Slack is not an option for this IOC !

We will be extremely reluctant to communicate by email with you about this IOC.

Indeed, emails capture information very poorly, because very often the subject headings
are poorly chosen (or not chosen at all...), conversations by email deal with heterogeneous
subjects, the recipients of a series of messages vary over time, and other joyful things -
the imagination of Internet users is limitless (and exhausting)... 

### GitHub
Git is a powerful versionning system.
The software was implemented in web environments to create even more powerful system of
continuous development and continuous integration.

This is the case of [GitHub](https://github.com) which we have chosen in ARTbio.
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is another option, which will not use here.

Good news ! there is a GitHub repository just for your IOC
[**here**](https://github.com/ARTbio/ARTbio_064_IOC_Bulk-RNAseq/tree/main). This repository
is private. Therefore, to access it, you will need to create a personal GitHub account, and
to communicate your GitHub identifier to be invited to contribute to (and benefit from)
the repository.

We are not going to use the repository
[ARTbio_064_IOC_Bulk-RNAseq](https://github.com/ARTbio/ARTbio_064_IOC_Bulk-RNAseq/tree/main)
intensively. However, we will try to take advantage of it to introduce you to the notions
of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, interoperability and reproducibility) and familiarize
you with the continuous integration and transparency of bioinformatics analyses.

!!! info "Disclosure"
    The learning curve of git and github is not steep for a biologist... which
    unfortunately means that you will have to make a substantial effort before
    understanding the benefit of GitHub and being able to manipulate it without
    discomfort. But if you make the necessary effort, rest assured that you won't regret
    it.
    
    For a very good introductory journal to Git and GitHub, although a bit old, see this
    [article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668)
    
    GitHub is also very good at teaching how to use it... You can go from
    [there](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart)!

### Psilo storage (15 min)
### Galaxy (65 min)
### Import data from Psilo to Galaxy

## Work Program of the week 1 - [Week-1 exercises]()

### Exercises with Slack (use of markdown, configuration, files, no-screen-shots, etc.)
### Exercises with GitHub (web version)
### Data upload in Galaxy, from Psilo
### Pretreatment (renaming and collections) and metadata organisations (and basic Galaxy manipulation)
